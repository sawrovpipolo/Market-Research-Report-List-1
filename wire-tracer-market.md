<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wire Tracer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Tracing</li><li>Passive Tracing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wire tracer market is categorized into two main types: active tracing and passive tracing. Active tracing involves the use of a generator that emits a signal specifically along the wire, allowing for precise locating and identification of wiring paths. In contrast, passive tracing detects signals from existing electrical currents in the wires without any external signal generation, making it useful for identifying wiring without disrupting the circuit. Both techniques are essential for efficient troubleshooting and maintenance in electrical systems.</p></p>
