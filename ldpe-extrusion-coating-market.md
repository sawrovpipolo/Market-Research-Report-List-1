<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LDPE Extrusion Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Process</li><li>Autoclave Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene) extrusion coating market primarily involves two processes: the tubular process and the autoclave process. The tubular process involves extruding molten LDPE through a die to form a continuous tube, which is then flattened and coated onto substrates like paper or film. In contrast, the autoclave process utilizes a closed chamber to apply heat and pressure, allowing for enhanced adhesion and thickness control. Both methods cater to diverse applications, including packaging and protective coatings, driven by efficiency and product performance.</p></p>
